The game utilizes event listeners to respond to keyboard inputs (button presses) and execute specific actions based on the keys pressed. The following buttons control different aspects of the game:

'N' Key: Next Question
Pressing the 'N' key moves the game to the next question, advancing the student to the next challenge.

'O', 'P', '[', ']': Selecting Answers
The keys 'O', 'P', '[', ']' correspond to answer options 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D', respectively. Pressing these keys allows the student to select their chosen answer.

Pressing the 'M' key toggles the background music on and off. If the music is playing, pressing 'M' will stop it and mute the game. Pressing 'M' again will resume playing the music.

Pressing the 'T' key allows the student to use the "Phone a Friend" lifeline to seek help with the question. If the "Phone a Friend" lifeline has not been used, pressing 'T' will activate it. If the student has already used "Phone a Friend," pressing 'T' will initiate a phone call. If the phone call is active, pressing 'F' will end the call.

Pressing the 'R' key allows the student to use the "Fifty-Fifty" lifeline to eliminate two incorrect answer options, leaving one correct and one incorrect answer. If the "Fifty-Fifty" lifeline has not been used, pressing 'R' will activate it.
